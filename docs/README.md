## Getting Started

1. **Prerequisites**
   ```bash
   Node.js 16.8 or later
   npm or yarn package manager
   ```

2. **Installation**
   ```bash
   # Clone the repository
   git clone [repository-url]

   # Install dependencies
   npm install
   # or
   yarn install
   ```

3. **Development**
   ```bash
   # Run development server
   npm run dev
   # or
   yarn dev
   ```

4. **Build**
   ```bash
   # Create production build
   npm run build
   # or
   yarn build
   ```

## Database Setup

The CRM uses a local SQLite database for data storage. Follow these steps to set up the database:

1. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

2. Generate Prisma client:
```bash
npx prisma generate
```

3. Create and apply database migrations:
```bash
npx prisma migrate dev --name init
```

4. Seed the database with sample data:
```bash
npx ts-node lib/db/seed.ts
```

The database file will be created at `prisma/dev.db`. This file contains all your CRM data and should be backed up regularly.

## Best Practices
